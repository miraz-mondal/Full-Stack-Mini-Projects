Chat, also known as online chat or internet chat, is a way of communication and interaction in real time on the Internet. This communication is based on text messages. Two or more people can communicate and also send pictures, videos or audio files.

There are many types of chats â€“ for example, ongoing or scheduled for a certain time. Chat requires a software or messenger application. Some chats require users to registrate or to sign up to join chat groups.

A chat application makes it easy to communicate with people anywhere in the world by sending and receiving messages in real time. With a chat app, users are able to receive the same engaging and lively interactions through custom messaging features, just as they would in person.
